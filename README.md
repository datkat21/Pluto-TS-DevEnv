## Getting Started - Linux / macOS

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code
- git
- bun

### Steps

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/datkat21/Pluto-TS-DevEnv
```

2. Open VS Code to this repository.
   - Open a terminal and run `bun start`.
3. Install and run the _Pluview_ app from the Pluto App Store
4. You should find your app(s) in the Pluview item in the tray.

## Getting Started - Windows

### Windows only

If you are on Windows, you will need WSL and Bun installed. You can get WSL distros from the Microsoft Store and install them from there. Once you have a WSL terminal, copy and run the [Bun install script](https://bun.sh). Make sure you also installed git for your distribution.

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code
  - The Remote - WSL extension (if on Windows)
- git
- bun

### Steps

**Make sure you are in a WSL directory (e.g. `cd ~`), as being in a NTFS folder doesn't let Bun watch for file changes and will break the functionality of the app.**
